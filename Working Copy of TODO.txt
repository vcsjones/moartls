You should always provide a 128x128 icon; it's used during installation and by the Chrome Web Store. 
Extensions should also provide a 48x48 icon, which is used in the extensions management page (chrome://extensions). 
You can also specify a 16x16 icon to be used as the favicon for an extension's pages.

Use PNG format, transparency is good. 

"icons": { "16": "icon16.png",
           "48": "icon48.png",
          "128": "icon128.png" },

For example, Windows often requires 32-pixel icons, and if the app includes a 32-pixel icon, Chrome will choose that instead of shrinking a 48-pixel icon down. However, you should ensure that all of your icons are square, or unexpected behavior may result.
If the icon is square, the main image should be 96x96px with a 16px transparent padding.

Applications and themes require at least one screenshot. Extensions may have no screenshots, but such extensions won't be shown in the gallery.
Provide preferably 4 or 5 screenshots of your app (up to a maximum of 5). If your app supports multiple locales, you can provide locale-specific screenshots. Your screenshot should have square corners and no padding (full bleed).
We prefer screenshots to be 1280x800 pixels in size, as they will be used in future high dpi displays. Currently, the Chrome Web Store will downscale all screenshots to 640x400, so if your screenshots will not look good downscaled (eg. have a lot of text) or if 1280x800 is too big for your app (screenshot of low resolution game), we also support 640x400 pixels screenshots.
