# moartls
moarTLS is a Browser Extension that flags non-secure links and downloads. 

It's my first Chrome extension, so I'm sure it's buggy.

Learn more about the extension in the [Announcement Blog Post](https://textplain.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/seek-and-destroy-non-secure-references-using-the-moartls-analyzer/)

You can install the Chrome extension from the [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moartls-analyzer/ldfbacdbackkjhclmhnjabngnppnkagh)

Opera/Firefox/Edge versions coming soon.
